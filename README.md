### Pop-up optimization

**⚠️ Important: Since v1.7.0, the optimized mode has been removed to ensure stability and to simplify updates for everyone. However, if your pop-up content still appears on the screen during page loading, you can take a look at this similar fix below.**

### Pop-up initialization fix

<details>

**<summary>Installation</summary>**

This is only for users of v1.7.0 and up.

If you notice that pop-up content appears upon page load, consider installing this fix as an additional module.

You can do this by adding `bubble-pop-up-fix.js` to your `configuration.yaml` like so:
```yaml
frontend:
  extra_module_url:
    - /hacsfiles/Bubble-Card/bubble-pop-up-fix.js
```
If you didn't install it with HACS, change the path accordingly. Then, clear your browser cache.

For Android HA Companion App users, you can close the app, then clear the app cache. If it's still not working, you can close and restart the app again.

For iOS HA Companion App users, you can go to your HA settings, then navigate to Companion App > Debug > Clear Frontend Cache (or something similar), then refresh the page or restart the app.

For previous users of the **Optimized mode**, you will need to replace your `type: custom:bubble-pop-up` with this in YAML mode:

```yaml
type: vertical-stack
cards:
  - type: custom:bubble-card
    card_type: pop-up
```

</details>

## Configuration

All options can be configured in the GUI editor.

<details>

**<summary>Main options (YAML + description)</summary>**

| Name | Type | Requirement | Supported options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | string | **Required** | `custom:bubble-card` | Type of the card |
| `card_type` | string | **Required** | `button`, `cover`, `empty-column`, `horizontal-buttons-stack`, `pop-up` or `separator` | Type of the Bubble Card, see below |
| `styles` | object list | Optional | Any CSS stylesheets | Allows you to customize your cards, see [styling](#styling) |

</details>

## Pop-up

This card allows you to convert any vertical stack into a pop-up. Each pop-up is hidden by default and can be opened by targeting its link (e.g., `'#pop-up-name'`), with any card that supports the `navigation_path` action, or with the horizontal buttons stack that is included.

**Important:** This card must be placed within a vertical stack card at the topmost position to function properly. To avoid misalignment with your layout, please place all your vertical stacks/pop-ups before any other cards on your dashboard.

1. To add a pop-up you first need to add a `vertical-stack` card to your dashboard
2. This `vertical-stack` must be before all your other cards in your view order
3. Now add a `Bubble Card` with the `Pop-up` type
4. Just fill in the `Hash` inputs and the ones you need

type: vertical-stack
cards:
  - type: custom:bubble-card
    card_type: pop-up
    hash: '#kitchen'
    name: Kitchen
    icon: mdi:fridge

<details>

**<summary>Opening a pop-up when a binary_sensor is `on`</summary>**

 ```yaml
type: custom:bubble-card
card_type: pop-up
hash: '#kitchen'
name: Security
icon: mdi:video
trigger_entity: binary_sensor.front_door_motion
trigger_state: 'on'
trigger_close: true
```

</details>

## Horizontal buttons stack

This card is a companion to the pop-up card, allowing you to open the corresponding pop-ups. It also allows you to open any page of your dashboard. In addition, you can add your motion sensors so that the order of the buttons adapts according to the room you just entered. This card is scrollable, remains visible, and acts as a footer.

**⚠️ Important: This card has to be the last one in your view (after every card and pop-up). It can't be inside any stack.**

```

## Tap, double tap and hold actions

You can also use HA default tap actions, double tap actions and hold actions on the icons of the buttons, the pop-ups and the covers. This allows you to display the “more info” window by holding the icon and to turn on/off the lamp of a slider by a single tap for example.

## Styling

You can directly use `styles: |` in YAML **without card-mod** which allows you to modify the CSS style of the pop-ups and all the other cards.

Please note that you will have to add `!important;` to some CSS styles that are already defined (see examples below).

**Some cards needs a page refresh to display your CSS modifications (like the pop-ups).**

### Examples

Here is how to change the `pop-up` background (you can do it with `bg_color`, `bg_opacity` and `bg_blur` now).

```yaml
styles: | 
  .pop-up {
    /* You can edit the last value (0.8) to change the opacity, 0 is transparent and 1 is the max value */
    background-color: rgba(79, 69, 87, 0.8) !important;

    /* Add blur on your background.
    backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  }
  bubble-card::after {
    /* Hide the gradient in the top of the pop-up */
    display: none !important;
  }
```

To change the font size of any Bubble Card:

```yaml
styles: |
  ha-card { 
    font-size: 12px;
  }
```

To change the background color of a single button in an `horizontal-buttons-stack`:

```yaml
styles: >
  /* Selector for the '#kitchen' button */
  .kitchen > .color-background {
    background-color: blue !important;
  }
```

To change the background color of a `button`:

```yaml
styles: | 
  ha-card > div > div > div { 
    background: blue !important; 
  }
```

Or the color of a `slider`:

```yaml
styles: |
  .range-fill { 
    background: rgba(79, 69, 87, 1) !important; 
  }
```

The Bubble theme (like on the screenshots) can be found here:

### Styles template

Advanced users can add templates in JS in their custom styles, here is an example of a button that is red when it's off and blue when it's on.

```yaml
type: custom:bubble-card
card_type: button
entity: switch.test
name: Test
styles: |
  .switch-button {
    background-color: ${state === 'on' ? 'blue' : 'red'} !important;
  }
```

More information here :
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_operator

For now, you have access to these variables in some cards (not all):

 `state` will return the state of your defined `entity`.  
 `entity` will return your entity you defined like `switch.test` in this example.  
 `hass` is an advanced variable that alows you even more control, more info [here](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/dev_101_hass/).

But in all cards you can also use this:

 `hass.states['light.kitchen'].state` will return the state of `light.kitchen`.  
 `hass.states['light.kitchen'].attributes.brightness` will return the brightness attribute of `light.kitchen`.

Here is an example on how you can change the background color of a button based on an entity for the horizontal buttons stack:

```yaml
styles: |
  .kitchen > .color-background {
    background-color: ${hass.states['light.kitchen'].state === 'on' ? 'blue' : 'red'} !important;
  }
```

## Custom components conflicts

⚠️ For now there are some features that are not working with:

- UI Lovelace Minimalist (see https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/issues/41)
- Lovelace state switch (see https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/issues/47)
- Kiosk mode, but here is a [workaround](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/bubble-card-a-minimalist-card-collection-for-home-assistant-with-a-nice-pop-up-touch/609678/121?u=cloos)

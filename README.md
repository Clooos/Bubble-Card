## Pop-up

![readme-pop-up](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/assets/36499953/086bdcc4-62aa-445b-b265-b57c4e38b8a0)

This card allows you to convert any vertical stack into a pop-up. Each pop-up is **hidden by default** and can be opened by targeting its link (e.g. `'#pop-up-name'`), with any card that supports the `navigate` [action](#tap-double-tap-and-hold-actions), or with the [horizontal buttons stack](#horizontal-buttons-stack) that is included.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To avoid misalignment with your view, place this card after all other dashboard cards. You can't trigger it from a different view.
>
> **For YAML only users:** This card must be placed within a [vertical stack](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/vertical-stack/) card at the topmost position to function properly. See example below.
>
> **You can also watch [this step by step video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mOV7BfWoFc).** This video is bit outdated, you don't need to create a vertical stack anymore, it will be added automatically.

> [!TIP]
> ### Pop-up trigger 
> This feature allows you to open a pop-up based on the state of any entity, for example, you can open a "Security" pop-up with a camera when a person is in front of your house. You can also create a toggle helper (input_boolean) and trigger its opening/closing in an automation.
> <details>
> <summary>Opening a pop-up when a <code>binary_sensor</code> is <code>on</code></summary>
> <br>
>
> ```yaml
> type: custom:bubble-card
> card_type: pop-up
> hash: '#kitchen'
> name: Security
> icon: mdi:video
> trigger_entity: binary_sensor.front_door_motion
> trigger_state: 'on'
> trigger_close: true
> ```
> 
> </details>
>
> ### Different ways to close a pop-up 
> They are many ways to close a pop-up. For instance, you can swipe from the pop-up header to the bottom, by doing a long swipe inside the pop-up to the bottom, by pressing Escape on desktop, by removing the hash in the URL or by simply pressing the close button.
>
> ### Pop-up initialization fix
> If you notice that pop-up content appears upon page load, consider installing this fix as an additional module.
> <details>
> <summary>Installation</summary>
> <br>
>
> You can do this by adding `bubble-pop-up-fix.js` to your `configuration.yaml` like so:
> ```yaml
> frontend:
>   extra_module_url:
>     - /hacsfiles/Bubble-Card/bubble-pop-up-fix.js
> ```
> If you didn't install it with HACS, change the path accordingly. Then, clear your browser cache.
> 
> For Android Home Assistant Companion App users, you can close the app, then clear the app cache. If it's still not working, you can close and restart the app again.
> 
> For iOS Home Assistant Companion App users, you can go to your Home Assistant settings, then navigate to Companion App > Debug > Clear Frontend Cache (or something similar), then refresh the page or restart the app.

## Horizontal buttons stack

This card is a good companion to the pop-up card, allowing you to open the corresponding pop-ups. It also allows you to open any page of your dashboard. In addition, you can add your motion/occupancy sensors so that the order of the buttons adapts according to the room you just entered. This card is scrollable, remains visible, and acts as a footer.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This card has to be the last one in your view (after every card and pop-up). It can't be inside any stack.

## Button

![readme-button-without-sub-buttons](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/assets/36499953/790cbe3c-bdcc-4242-81ac-48e6ca2f1d46)

This card is very versatile. It can be used as a **switch**, a **slider**, a **state** or a **name/text** button.

> [!TIP]
> ### What are the differences between all the button types?
>
> - **Switch button:** This is the default button type. By default, it toggles an entity and its background color changes based on the entity's state or the color of a light. You can change its action in the **Tap action on card** section.
>
> - **Slider button:** This button type lets you control entities with adjustable ranges. It's ideal for dimming lights, and its fill color will adapt to the light's color. You can also use it to display values, such as a battery level.
>   Supported entities for sliders:
>   - Light (brightness)
>   - Media player (volume)
>   - Cover (position)
>   - Fan (percentage)
>   - Climate (temperature)
>   - Input number and number (value)
>   - Battery sensor (percentage, read only)
>
>   You can also use any entity with a numeric state by disabling the entity filter in **Slider settings**, then define the `min` and `max` values. This option is read only.
>
> - **State button:** Perfect for displaying information from a sensor or any entity. When you press it, it will show the "More info" panel of the entity. Its background color does not change.
>
> - **Name/Text button:** The only button type that doesn't need an entity. It allows you to display a short text, a name or a title. You can also add actions to it. Its background color does not change.

## Calendar

![readme-calendar-bubble-card](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b6a231c-c99b-4d7a-8197-b7fd49952f62)

This card allows you to display your calendar entities. Its content is scrollable, so you can easily browse upcoming events.

## Separator

![readme-separator](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/assets/36499953/7e416a34-b95e-4a03-a200-4b3aa04f560d)

This card is a simple separator for dividing your pop-up into categories / sections. e.g. Lights, Devices, Covers, Settings, Automations...

### Separator options

<details>

**<summary>Options (YAML + descriptions)</summary>**

| Name | Type | Requirement | Supported options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Optional but recommended | Any string | A name for your separator |
| `icon` | string | Optional but recommended | Any `mdi:` icon | An icon for your separator |
| `card_layout` | string | Optional | `normal` (default if not in section view), `large` (default if in section view), `large-2-rows`, `large-sub-buttons-grid` | Styling layout of the card, see [card layouts](#card-layouts) |
| `rows` | number | Optional | Any number | Number of rows (height) (e.g. `2`) |
| `sub_button` | object | Optional | See [sub-buttons](#sub-buttons) | Add customized buttons fixed to the right |

</details>

<details>

**<summary>CSS variables (see [Styling](#styling))</summary>**

| Variable | Expected value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--bubble-line-background-color` | `color` | Background color for the line in the separator |

</details>

#### Example

<details>

<summary>A separator/divider for a "Covers" section</summary>

<br>

```yaml
type: custom:bubble-card
card_type: separator
name: Covers
icon: mdi:window-shutter
```

</details>

## Empty column

![readme-empty-column](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/assets/36499953/a97fa8df-8360-4613-8bb7-e8a269cb1913)

This card is here to fill an empty column. This is useful if you have a `horizontal-stack` in your pop-up with only one card. Take a look at the bottom right corner of this screenshot to (not) see it.

### Empty column options

This card has no options and doesn’t support [styling](#styling), though it does support layout options for HA sections.

#### Example

<details>

<summary>An empty column in an horizontal stack</summary>

<br>

```yaml
type: horizontal-stack
cards:
  - type: custom:bubble-card
    card_type: button
    ...
  - type: custom:bubble-card
    card_type: empty-column
```

</details>

<br>

<br>

## Sub-buttons

![readme-button](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/assets/36499953/c7bfda91-943e-42f3-a963-4847e57c6b97)

In every card that supports that option, you can add sub-buttons to customize your cards even more. You can, for example, create a button that can control a vacuum, a weather card, or almost anything that you can come up with. These sub-buttons support the tap actions and most of the button options.

These sub-buttons can also display dropdown menus if combined with selectable entities like:

- Input Select entities
- Select entities
- Media players with **source list**
- Media players with **sound mode list**
- Climate entities with **hvac modes**
- Climate/Fan entities with **fan modes**
- Climate entities with **swing modes**
- Climate entities with **preset modes**
- Light entities with **effect list**

## Card layouts

![My-Bubble-Card-dashboard](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/assets/36499953/0c049498-969b-4939-959e-fc49fb08d0a1)

Bubble Card fully supports the Home Assistant section view, you can change the card layout to make the card bigger and also change the number of columns or rows the card should occupy in your section view (only on the cards that support that option). These layouts are also supported in all other view types.

<details>

**<summary>Available card layouts</summary>**

| Layout | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `normal` | The regular layout (not optimized for the section view) |
| `large` | A larger layout that will resize to the selected rows in the section view (optimized for the section view) |
| `large-2-rows` | A larger layout with 2 rows of sub-buttons that will resize to the selected rows in the section view (optimized for the section view) |
| `large-sub-buttons-grid` | This layout will displays sub-buttons in a grid, `rows` must be set to at least `2`.

</details>

#### Examples

<details>

<summary>A large button that shows energy statistics with 2 rows of sub-buttons (screenshot included)</summary>

<br>

## Tap, double tap and hold actions

You can also use Home Assistant default tap actions, double tap actions and hold actions on the cards that supports this option. For example, this allows you to display the “more info” window by holding a button icon or running a service when a sub-button is pressed.

**Note: When a `double_tap_action` is configured, the regular `tap_action` will have a delay of 200ms to allow detection
of a double tap. If this delay is undesirable, set `double_tap_action` to `none` to disable double tap handling.**

### Action options

<details>

**<summary>Options (YAML + description)</summary>**

| Name | Type | Supported options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `action` | string | `more-info`, `toggle`, `call-service`, `navigate`, `url`, `fire-dom-event`, `none` | Action to perform |
| `target` | object |  | Only works with `call-service`. Follows the [home-assistant syntax](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/scripts/service-calls/#targeting-areas-and-devices) |
| `navigation_path` | string | Any path of your dashboard | Path to navigate to (e.g. `'#kitchen'` for opening a pop-up) when action defined as navigate |
| `url_path` | string | Any link | URL to open on click (e.g. `https://www.google.com`) when action is `url` |
| `service` | string | Any service | Service to call (e.g. `media_player.media_play_pause`) when `action` defined as `call-service` |
| `data` or `service_data` | object | Any service data | Service data to include (e.g. `entity_id: media_player.kitchen`) when `action` defined as `call-service` |
| `confirmation` | object | See [confirmation](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/actions/#options-for-confirmation) | Display a confirmation pop-up (not a Bubble Card one), overrides the default `confirmation` object |

</details>

#### Example

<details>

<summary>A button to open a pop-up</summary>

<br>

```yaml
type: custom:bubble-card
card_type: button
button_type: name
name: Kitchen
icon: mdi:fridge
button_action:
  tap_action:
    action: navigate
    navigation_path: '#kitchen'
```

</details>

## Styling

You can add custom styles to modify the CSS of all cards **without using card-mod** in four ways:

- In the editor, go to the card you want to modify, then navigate to _Styling options > Custom styles & JS templates_, and add your custom styles (check the tips and examples below).
- In the editor (or in [YAML](#modules)), go to the card you want to modify, then navigate to _Modules_, then create a new module (it will be available to all cards), or go to the **Module Store** to install any available Module (more details about modules can be found [below](#modules)).
- In a [theme](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/frontend/#defining-themes) file by adding CSS variables in YAML (these are available in each card's documentation above). This allows for global modifications.

  <details>
  
  <summary>Example</a></summary>
  
  <br>

  Don't copy the `Bubble:` line, this is the name of the theme you use. You also need to remove the `--` from the variables.

  You need to run the [`frontend.reload_themes`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/frontend/#setting-themes) action to refresh the theme after any modifications.

  ```yaml
  Bubble:  
    # Bubble Card variables test
    bubble-border-radius: "8px"
    bubble-main-background-color: "rgb(50,70,90)"
    bubble-secondary-background-color: "rgb(0,70,90)"
    bubble-pop-up-main-background-color: "rgba(200,200,200,0.5)"
    bubble-accent-color: "rgb(100,140,180)"
    bubble-icon-background-color: "rgb(50,80,100)"
    bubble-select-list-width: "200px"
    bubble-select-list-background-color: "rgb(100,140,180)"
  ```
  
  </details>
  
- In YAML by adding `styles: |` followed by your custom styles (check the tips and examples below).

> [!TIP]  
> **To understand which style classes can be modified**, you can take a look at the [`src/cards`](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/tree/main/src/cards) folder in this repository. In each card folder, you will find a file named `styles.css`. These files contain all the applied styles. This allows for a lot more possibilities than CSS variables, but it needs to be added individually to each card.
> 
> You can also find a lot of [examples from the community](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/discussions/categories/share-your-custom-styles-templates-and-dashboards), or some from the [Home Assistant forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/bubble-card-a-minimalist-card-collection-for-home-assistant-with-a-nice-pop-up-touch/) by doing a bit of searching.
>
> The Bubble theme for Home Assistant (like on the screenshots) can be found [here](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble).
>
> A tutorial video is coming soon on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@cloooos)!

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Please note that you might have to add `!important;` to some CSS styles that are already defined (see examples below).

#### Examples

styles: |
  * { 
    font-size: 16px !important;

<summary>Changing the background color of a card</summary>

<br>

This one works on all Bubble Card types (except for the pop-ups):

```yaml
styles: | 
  ha-card {
    --bubble-main-background-color: rgba(12,120,50,0.5) !important;
  }
```

This one is doing the same in a button card only (it works for the pop-up header): 

```yaml
styles: | 
  .bubble-button-card-container {
    background: rgba(12,120,50,0.5) !important;
  }
```

To change the color when it's `on` take a look at the style templates below.

## Templates

**Bubble Card doesn’t support Jinja templates** but advanced users can add templates in JS directly in their [custom styles](#styling). For example, this allows you to dynamically change an icon, the texts or the colors of an element, to show or hide an element conditionally (like a sub-button), or almost anything based on a state, an attribute and more.

> [!TIP]  
> More information about JS templates [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_operator). My advice is to **always take a look at your browser console** to be sure that everything is working correctly.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **All templates that are not modifying a CSS property must be placed at the end! Like modifying an icon, a text or any element.**

#### Available variables and functions

<details>

<summary>Variables</summary>

<br>

You have access to these variables in most cards:

- `state` will return the state of your defined `entity`.
  
- `entity` will return your entity you defined like `switch.test` in this example.
  
- `icon` can be used like this to change the icon `icon.setAttribute("icon", "mdi:lightbulb")`.

- `subButtonState[0]` will return the state of your first sub-button defined `entity`, `[0]` is the first sub-button state, `[1]` the second...
  
- `subButtonIcon[0]` can be used like this to change the first sub-button icon `subButtonIcon[0].setAttribute("icon", "mdi:lightbulb")`, `[0]` is the first sub-button icon, `[1]` the second...
  
- `card` will return the card element in the DOM.
  
- `hass` is an advanced variable that allows you even more control, for example you can return the state of `light.kitchen` like this `hass.states['light.kitchen'].state` or an attribute like this `hass.states[entity].attributes.brightness`.

- `this` will return a lot of usefull informations about your setup and dashboard, only use this if you know what you are doing.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Functions</summary>

<br>

You have access to all the global JS functions, but you have also access to:

- `getWeatherIcon` can be used to return a weather icon based on a state that return the weather. For example, you can can do this `${subButtonIcon[2].setAttribute("icon", getWeatherIcon(hass.states['sensor.weather_forecast_daily'].attributes.forecast[0]?.condition))}` to change the third sub-button icon to today's weather icon, `.forecast[1]?.condition` is for tomorrow...

  You will have to create a template sensor for that. Here is what you can add in your `configuration.yaml`:
  ```yaml
    - trigger:
        - platform: time_pattern
          hours: /2
      action:
        - service: weather.get_forecasts
          data:
            type: daily
          target:
            entity_id: weather.home
          response_variable: daily
      sensor:
        - name: Weather Forecast Daily
          unique_id: weather_forecast_daily
          state: "{{ now().isoformat() }}"
          attributes:
            forecast: "{{ daily['weather.home'].forecast }}"
  ```
- `hass.formatEntityState(state)` can be used to transtale a state (Can also be used to get a state unit, without the need to add it manually).
- `hass.formatEntityAttributeValue(state, "attribute")` can be used to translate an attribute (Can also be used to get a state unit, without the need to add it manually).

</details>

#### Examples

You can find a lot of examples below, but you can also find very advanced templates on my [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/c/Clooos), like one (my favorite) that allows up to four conditional badges placed around the card’s icons. It’s also a great way to learn about all the possibilities of Bubble Card custom styles and templates!

## Modules

Modules are a powerful feature that allows you to save, reuse, and share your custom styles and templates across all of your Bubble Cards. Instead of copying and pasting the same code into multiple cards, you can create a Module and apply it wherever you need it. This makes managing your dashboard's look and feel much easier and more efficient.

But this feature is so much more powerful than that, it lets you add actual features yourself in the Bubble Card editor, using all the default [Home Assistant form](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/blob/main/src/modules/editor-schema-docs.md) options!

You can also browse the **Module Store** to find and install [modules created by the community](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/discussions/categories/share-your-modules), or share your own creations!

> [!TIP]
> A Module's code works exactly the same way as the code in the `styles` section of a card. All the same variables and functions from the [Templates](#templates) section are available.

<br>

### Initial Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you can use Modules, you need to configure storage for them. There are two methods depending on whether you use the **editor** or **YAML-only configuration**.

#### Method 1: With editor support (Recommended)

This method allows you to use the Module Editor and the Module Store.

<details>

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

<br>

1. Add the following template sensor to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Storage for Bubble Card Modules
template:
  - trigger:
      - trigger: event
        event_type: bubble_card_update_modules
    sensor:
      - name: "Bubble Card Modules"
        state: "saved"
        icon: "mdi:puzzle"
        attributes:
          modules: "{{ trigger.event.data.modules }}"
          last_updated: "{{ trigger.event.data.last_updated }}"
```

2. Save the file and restart Home Assistant.
3. You can now access the Module Editor and Module Store from any Bubble Card!

<br>

</details>

#### Method 2: YAML-only configuration

This method is for users who prefer to work exclusively in YAML without using the visual editor.

<details>

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

<br>

1. Create a file called `bubble-modules.yaml` in a newly created `/www/bubble/` folder.
2. Structure your modules in the file like in this [example](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/blob/main/dist/bubble-modules-example.yaml), check the last module for more details.


<br>

</details>

<br>

### The Module Editor

You can access the Module Editor from any card's settings, under the **Modules** section. The editor provides two main tabs:

#### My Modules tab

![module-editor-preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94b4b481-2d51-4f7b-8c02-1a65391d78ca)

This tab shows all your installed modules and allows you to:

- **Apply** existing modules to the current card
- **Create** a new module from scratch
- **Edit** existing modules with live preview
- **Delete** modules you no longer need
- **Set global status** to make a module apply to all cards automatically
- **Import/Export** modules for backup or sharing

#### Module Store tab

![update-module-store-s](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7249c0c-8f8c-4ffc-835f-701c9dfcadaf)

This tab will display [all available modules from the community](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/discussions/categories/share-your-modules), and allows you to:

- **Browse** all community-created modules
- **Search** and filter modules by name, compatibility, or keywords
- **Install** modules with one click
- **Update** installed modules when new versions are available

<br>

### How to use modules

#### Creating a new module

<details>

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

<br>

![module-preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4670b486-5a48-4476-a868-2ec4d42226a5)

1. Go to any card's editor and expand the **Modules** section.
2. Click on **Create new module**.
3. Fill in the module information.
4. Write your CSS and/or JavaScript template code in the **Code** editor.
5. (Optional) Create a custom configuration UI in the **Editor** section (like the color picker in the screenshot above, full documentation available [here](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/blob/main/src/modules/editor-schema-docs.md)).
6. Click **Save**.

Your module is now available to be used on any of your cards!

<br>

</details>

#### Applying a module to a card

<details>

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

<br>

- **Via the editor:**

  - Go to the editor of the card you want to apply the module to.
  - Expand the **Modules** section.
  - Click on the module you want to apply from the list.
  - Under "Apply to", click on "This card". The module is now active. You can apply multiple modules to the same card.

- **Via YAML:**

  ```yaml
  type: custom:bubble-card
  card_type: button
  entity: light.example
  modules:
    - module_id_1
    - module_id_2
  ```

<br>

</details>

#### Applying a module globally

<details>

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

<br>

You can set a module to apply automatically to all Bubble Cards:

**This is not available for modules with an editor, as those require a specific configuration to work.**

- **Via the editor:**

  - In the Module editor, find your module in the **My Modules** tab.
  - Toggle the **All cards** button next to the module name.
  - The module will now be applied to all cards automatically.
 
- **Via YAML:**

  In your module YAML configuration (in `bubble-modules.yaml`), just add `is_global: true`.

<br>

</details>

#### Excluding a single card from a global module

<details>

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

<br>

If you have a global module but want to exclude it from a specific card:

- **Via the editor:**
  
  - In the card's **Modules** section, you'll see global modules listed.
  - Click on a global module, disable "This card" to exclude it from this specific card.

- **Via YAML:**
  
  ```yaml
  type: custom:bubble-card
  card_type: button
  entity: light.example
  modules:
    - !global_module_id  # The ! prefix excludes this global module
  ```

<br>

</details>

#### Sharing your module to the Module Store

<details>

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

<br>

To share your Module to the Module Store, in the Module Editor, at the bottom in "Export Module", click on "Copy for GitHub" and paste the content in a new discussion in the [Share your Modules](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card/discussions/categories/share-your-modules) category. **Edit the description** (if needed), **the example** (for YAML users), and remember to **include at least one screenshot** for the Module Store.

**Your Module becomes available right after that** (after a Store refresh), so double-check that everything is correctly written and the Module is working as expected. You can of course edit/update the Module after it is shared.

<br>

</details>

#### Version management

<details>

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

<br>

The Module Store automatically checks for updates to installed modules. When updates are available:

1. You'll see an update indicator in the **Module Store** tab.
2. Click **Update** in modules with available updates.
3. Confirm the update in the Module Store.

<br>

</details>

#### Defining supported card types

<details>

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

<br>

Some modules may not be compatible with all card types. You can specify which cards a module support:

```yaml
my_module:
  name: "Button Only Module"
  supported:
    - button
  code: |
    /* Your module code here */
```

</details>

<br>

### Examples

<details>
